It has been shown in both field trials and the lab that it can stimulate plant growth, and abiotic stress tolerance. Chitosan has been shown to improve the tolerance of tomatoes to heat stress, increasing productivity. In a study with lettuce, a chitosan-based biostimulant improved yield (biomass) and quality (chlorophyll & total phenolic content, & antiradical activity). In a field experiment with wheat it was clearly demonstrated that foliar treatment of chitosan significantly increased the grain yield, as well as increasing the photosynthetic pigments, total soluble sugar, proline, free amino acid total carbohydrates, antioxidant activities, phenol, flavonoids, and mineral content of wheat plants. Significant increases of different endogenous phytohormones auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, and cytokinins were also observed along with improved nutritive values, carbohydrates, proteins & antioxidant compounds. However, studies have also shown that the effectiveness of chitosan biostimulants depends on different chitosan-based structures and concentrations as well as the plant species and developmental stage.

In another study with lettuce plants subjected to extreme heat and cold, blood meal was shown to reduce damage.

It has been shown in both field trials and the lab that it can stimulate plant growth, and abiotic stress tolerance. Chitosan has been shown to improve the tolerance of tomatoes to heat stress, increasing productivity. In a study with lettuce, a chitosan-based biostimulant improved yield (biomass) and quality (chlorophyll & total phenolic content, & antiradical activity). In a field experiment with wheat it was clearly demonstrated that foliar treatment of chitosan significantly increased the grain yield, as well as increasing the photosynthetic pigments, total soluble sugar, proline, free amino acid total carbohydrates, antioxidant activities, phenol, flavonoids, and mineral content of wheat plants. Significant increases of different endogenous phytohormones auxins, abscisic acid, gibberellins, and cytokinins were also observed along with improved nutritive values, carbohydrates, proteins & antioxidant compounds. However, studies have also shown that the effectiveness of chitosan biostimulants depends on different chitosan-based structures and concentrations as well as the plant species and developmental stage.

The males are completely dark brown whereas females have different markings. The thorax is straw coloured, the wings are transparent with a smoky patch in the centre and the legs are whitish-grey. Females deposit their eggs inside nymphs or pupae of the host whitefly. The wasp larvae develop and feed on their host. Wasp pupation occurs within the whitefly body, from which adult wasps emerge about 10 days after.

The formulated product is an off-white granular solid.,"Trial results also show good efficacy against weevils, wire worm, thrips and other agricultural insect and mite pests. Best results seen at temperatures 25-30 DegC. Appearance and life cycle Filamentous fungal spores. Life cycle consists of two phases. Firstly, the parasitic phases whereby the spores germinate on the cuticle and then penetrate the insect germinates, and colonise with the formation of blastospores. Secondly, during the saprophytic phase spores are disseminated into soil.

However, not all plants respond to the same extent or in the same way. In a study with dwarf pea plants, which naturally have short internodes, treatment with gibberellins produced significantly elongated stems. Seedless grapes treated with Gibberellins had significantly increased yields, enhancing both the size and quality of the fruit. In the brewing industry, gibberellins are used to stimulate the germination of barley seeds, which is a crucial step in the production of malt.

Application to grapevines has been found to enhance berry size and improve cluster compactness. This leads to higher market value and better quality produce. Gibberellic acid treatment to wheat has been shown to increase stem elongation, leading to taller plants with more biomass. With tomatoes, gibberellic acid has been shown to promote early flowering and fruit set, leading to an extended harvest period and increased total yield.

As a herbicide, lab studies have shown that, at concentrations from 7.5% to 10% w/v, it can inhibit seed germination, seedling emergence and growth of the weed redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), without affecting maize performance. In other species (e.g. carrot & rapeseed), the liquor acts as a biostimulant, improving seedling germination and growth. However, in other species (e.g. onion, tomato, lettuce) no significant effect has been seen. There are a few published studies available which support claims that corn steep liquor may protect plants from specific abiotic and biotic stresses (extreme temperatures, nutritional limitations, salinity, drought, pathogens). Study results showed that application of the liquor increased aerial biomass and leaf area of various agricultural and horticultural crops under normal and saline conditions. In addition, studies have observed improved stress resiliance when grown in hydroponic systems with the liquor.

However, not all plants respond to the same extent or in the same way. In a study with dwarf pea plants, which naturally have short internodes, treatment with gibberellins produced significantly elongated stems. Seedless grapes treated with Gibberellins had significantly increased yields, enhancing both the size and quality of the fruit. In the brewing industry, gibberellins are used to stimulate the germination of barley seeds, which is a crucial step in the production of malt.

Application to grapevines has been found to enhance berry size and improve cluster compactness. This leads to higher market value and better quality produce. Gibberellic acid treatment to wheat has been shown to increase stem elongation, leading to taller plants with more biomass. With tomatoes, gibberellic acid has been shown to promote early flowering and fruit set, leading to an extended harvest period and increased total yield.

A vineyard study identified a physiological response with vines treated with triacontanol with grapes having higher enological parameters (sugars, total titrable acidity and citric acid content) than the non-treated at every stage. Triaconanol treated grapes reached full maturity earlier than the non-treated. There was also a positive effect on must (grape juice) microbial ecology important for winemaking. In another study triacontanol was shown to be a potent alleviator of stress induced by salt and heavy metal contamination in plants.

In one study, wheat seeds pretreated with Zeatins or demonstrated improved plant hormonal content, polyamine gene expression, and tolerance to salinity and drought stress. Similarly, maize seeds treated with a zeatin-type cytokinin biostimulator showed significantly improved salt tolerance by enhancing the antioxidant system and photosynthetic efficiency. Zeatin also increased the growth and biochemical parameters of an oregano crop.
